# Ask For Help

This is an option available when the PC is working on a [Code Block](./CodeBlocks.md).

## Activating Help

During a Code Block attempt, if the PC is timid or delusional, the player can click a button to request help. A randomly chosen instructor will "help" the player by revealing the correct version of the code. Full coder points are awarded for the code block.

There's a chance that the instructor will give a "ThumbsUp", which boosts confidence. The ThumbsUp values are set separately for each instructor in the database.

# Ask For Help

This is an option available when the PC is working on a [Code Block](./CodeBlocks.md) and will be available in the [Code Block Minigame](./CodeBlockMinigame.md).

## Activating Help

During a Code Block attempt, the player can click a button or something and request help. An [Instructor NPC](./Characters.md) arrives (randomly chosen) and there's a quick random dialogue exchange. The Code Block finishes rapidly and full work points are awarded.

There's a chance that the instructor will give a "ThumbsUp", which will have an affect on confidence.

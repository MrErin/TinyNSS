# Events

Events are planned occurrences that will give the player opportunities to meet basic needs and to gain points towards winning. Some events are optional and some are required.

## Calculations

To participate in any optional activities, only the PC's energy level will be taken into account. There will not be a wellness check.

Random effects in events: there is a 25% chance that the PC will receive either a buff or debuff from the event.

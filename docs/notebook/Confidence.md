# Confidence

Confidence exists for the PC as a scale or range and affects the difficulty of the Code Blocks minigame as well as the points awarded from the game.

In general, if the PC has too much confidence s/he becomes delusional and is unable to learn well because s/he is convinced s/he already knows everything. If the PC has too little confidence, s/he becomes timid and has difficulty learning because s/he believes it an impossible task.

## Confidence Range

* Confidence status is a range of 0-10
  * 0 - 3: Timid
  * 4 - 6: Sweet Spot. Any action that "stabilizes" confidence is seeking to bring the PC into this range without going over or below it.
  * 7 - 10: Delusional
* If adding a means of changing game difficulty later, adjusting these ranges would probably be the easiest point to do so.

# Project X

The wiki contains detailed notes on the design process and gameplay decisions. The [README](../../README.md): contains the working TODOs/requirements for the project and, once deployed, will have the instructions for installation and play.

This page is my landing page for notes and other ephemera. It's messy. Don't read it.

See [Sprint List](./sprintList.md) for detailed changelog as sprints are completed.

## Requirement Variables:

Search the wiki for the following variables as final decisions are made:

* "X": usually an amount as in '"X" amount of points'
* "Y": usually a calculation, as in "using 'Y' formula"

## Sections That Still Definitely Need Definition


## Notes to file


## Game Design

* [Gameplay Experience](./Gameplay.md)
* [User Interface & HUD](./Interface.md)

## Art Design

* [Art](./Art.md)

## Game Mechanics

* [BasicNeeds](./BasicNeeds.md)
* [CodeBlocks](./CodeBlocks.md)
* [Days](./Days.md)

## Stretch Goals

* Fully developing the [Code Block Minigame](./CodeBlockMinigame.md) and the [Confidence](./Confidence) mechanic.
* Allowing player to adjust difficulty of game (probably accomplished by changing the sweet spot range of [confidence](./Confidence.md) or the rate of decay on Game Difficulty object
* Allowing player to adjust character to play as an introvert or as a no-nonsense coder, which would change the rate of decay for the [basic needs](./BasicNeeds.md) and/or change the amount a given action will top off the need. For example: to an introvert, one party would be plenty to fill up a social bar, but for an extrovert, they will likely want to attend every social gathering.

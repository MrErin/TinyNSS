# Basic Needs

The basic needs combine to calculate the PC's wellness score.

## Individual Needs:

* Sleep
* Food
* Fun
* Social

## Wellness Check

The wellness method on the PC is a rollup of the individual needs. Before attempting a Code Block, the PC must have enough available energy and a high enough wellness score, or the attempt will fail and [confidence](./Confidence.md) may take a hit.

## Mechanics:

* The four needs are constantly decaying at varying rates
  * Stretch goal: the rate of decay could be randomly varied (except for sleep) in order to simulate people who, for example, don't need much socialiazation vs. those who need a ton of it. The user could make these selections (or some of them anyway) in choices on a setup screen.
* Three of the needs can be temporarily bolstered by player actions:
  * Food
    * Eating
    * Group lunch
  * Recreation
    * Game night
    * Reading a book
    * Attending a party
  * Camaraderie
    * Attending a party
    * Group Work assignments
    * Meetups
    * Group lunch
* The need for sleep cannot be mitigated. It is also the limiting factor to how much time the PC has during the day for completing Code Blocks or meeting other needs.

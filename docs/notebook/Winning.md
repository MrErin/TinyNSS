# Winning

As long as the PC makes it to day 10, the player has "won" the game. 

The game saves the player's coder point total to local storage at the end of day 10. If the new score is higher than an existing score, the new score overwrites the existing one. The player's current highgest score from local storage is displayed in the game's dashboard.

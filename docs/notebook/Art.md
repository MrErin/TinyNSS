## Spitballing

* Everyone looks like those Ms. Happy characters: a big circle with feet. The characters could be randomly colored and possibly even drawn in CSS (though that's probably asking a little much.)
* Possibly just use cutsey shapes similar to Oz's Bob books, then I'm not on the hook to try to draw an actual person.

## Sprite Sheets

* Player Character
  * Figure out some way to make it race/gender neutral?

## Backgrounds

* NSS Classroom 1
* Hackery
* Snackery
* Code Block minigame background

## Wrapper for Game Viewer

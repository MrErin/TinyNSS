# Art

Consider: everyone looks like those Ms. Happy characters: a big circle with feet. The characters could be randomly colored and possibly even drawn in CSS (though that's probably asking a little much.)

## Sprite Sheets

* Player Character
  * Figure out some way to make it race/gender neutral?
  * Possibly just use cutsey shapes similar to Oz's Bob books, then I'm not on the hook to try to draw an actual person.
* Steve (use Slack image)
  * Styled like a coach - maybe with a whistle, and his cat's paw pointer
* Kimmy (use Slack image)
* Jisie (use Slack image)

## Backgrounds

* NSS Classroom 1
* Hackery
* Snackery
* Code Block minigame background

## Wrapper for Game Viewer

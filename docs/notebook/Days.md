# Days

There are 11 total days (the unfinished Day 0 tutorial and 10 regular game days). When the PC runs out of energy, the player must end the day and begin a new one to refill the energy and continue playing. After 10 days, the player's score is added to local storage and the player is invited to refresh the game and play again.

# Front-End Capstone

My front-end capstone is an HTML/Javascript game that simulates the experience of being an NSS student using an interface inspired by Tamagotchi virtual pets. The player must care for their student and keep their student in optimal health so that the student can learn to code.

See the [notebook](./docs/notebook/readme.md) for detailed design decisions.

## Currently Working On:

* Core sprint: refactoring the tinkercode

## Current Problem:
